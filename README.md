# Hi

I am a 16-year-old programmer and game designer with a passion for developing horror games and useful (or random) desktop apps. I have been programming and developing games since the age of 12.

The game engine I typically use for my games is Unity, but I aspire to create my own one day. I also have extensive experience with [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

When developing apps, my language of choice is typically Java or Python. I would, however, like to use C# for an app one day, and not only use it for Unity.

Besides releasing a few GOOD games, my ultimate goal is to learn C++, as it is good for app & engine/game development - and also since I already have basic knowledge on C.

Thanks for reading\
bye
