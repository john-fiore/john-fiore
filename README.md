# Hi, I'm John.

I'm a 17-year-old high school student from the Chicago suburbs, and I have a passion for programming, game design, video games, and music. I've been programming and tinkering with game design since the age of 12, and have loved it ever since. I've been playing video games and using computers ever since I was a wee lad, and have always been intrigued by how video games and apps are made and the work that goes into it. Ever since then, I've set out with one simple goal: to make others happy.

I have experience in numerous langauges, including **Python**, **Java**, **BASIC**, **C**, and **Webdev languages (HTML, JS, CSS)**.

I also have experience in many engines as well, including **Unity**, **Unreal Engine**, **Godot**, **Construct 3**, and even **Blitz3D**.

Currently, I am working on an atmospheric-psychological horror game in **Unreal Engine 4** that is inspired by other games like *Cry of Fear*, *Amnesia: The Dark Descent*, and the original *Silent Hill 2*.

I haven't released a whole lot (that I'm proud of, at least) besides an [academic grade calculator](https://john-fiore.github.io/GradeCalc/) and [various Garry's Mod addons](https://steamcommunity.com/id/JOHNIN94/myworkshopfiles/?appid=4000&sort=score&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall).

In my free time (when I'm not working on my game or schoolwork), I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and modding various games, which, if I ever release any of them, you'll more than likely be able to find them on [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/members/epicjohndev) (or GameBanana, depending on the game). My favorite music genres are Industrial, Black Metal, and EDM, and my favorite games right now are *Cry of Fear*, *Garry's Mod*, *Alice: Madness Returns*, *POSTAL 2*, *DOOM*, and *Quake*.
