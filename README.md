# Hi

My name is John, I'm 17, and I have a passion for programming, game design, and music. I have been programming and tinkering with game design since the age of 12, and have experience in numerous languages and engines. 

Outside of development, however, I love playing video games, watching movies, and music (in fact, I am an aspiring musician too!). I love horror games, FPS games, and a few different music genres; which right now is industrial, DSBM (read that carefully please), and a lot of more-so instrumental music (soundtracks, classical, etc.)

As of right now, I am working on a **horror game** in the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), but also have extensive experience with Unity and little experience with Unreal Engine 4 & 5. I also have a small amount of experience with the ancient **Blitz3D engine**, which I first started tinkering with at 13-14 on a really old computer.

For programming, I mainly use **Java** and **Python**, but I also have experience with other languages like Webdev, C, C#, and C++ (although this is not a preference of mine). I intend on making GUI-based apps, but also have/will make some basic CLI-based apps as well - most of which won't be of "serious use."

As of right now, I don't have much that I'd say is "worthy of recognition," besides my website [GradeCalc](https://john-fiore.github.io/GradeCalc), which is an academic-based percentage, or grading, calculator. You can also find its source code here on my page.

Anyway, that is all. Thank you for reading!
