## hi

My name is John, I'm 15, and I like to program apps and video games.

Stuff about me:
- My favorite game ever is Portal 2
- I use both Unity AND Unreal Engine
- I am currently working on a horror game in Unreal Engine 5
- My favorite language is C#, and my least favorite is Rust and Objective-C
- My all-time favorite gaming console is the Nintendo Wii
- My ultimate goal is to learn Assembly, fully develop a good game, and write my own engine

My biggest inspirations when it comes to game development are John Carmack (DOOM, Quake), Warren Spector (Deus Ex, Epic Mickey), and Gabe Newell (Half-Life, Portal, TF)

I am a male, and I am from the western suburbs of Chicago, IL.
