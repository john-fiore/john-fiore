# Hi

I'm a 17-year-old high school student from the Chicago suburbs, and I have a passion for programming, game design, video games, and music. I've been programming and tinkering with game design since the age of 12, and have experience in numerous languages and engines.

My programming languages of choice are **Python** and **Java**, but have experience with Webdev, C, C++, and C#.

My game engine of choice is [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), but have experience with Unity and Unreal Engine.

---

As of now, I am developing a psychological horror game in **Godot** inspired by other horror games like *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* and *Silent Hill 2*. I am mainly doing this project solo, and have not made anything relating to the game itself public - nor do I plan on doing so.
