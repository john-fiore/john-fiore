# Hi

My name is John, and I am a 16-year-old programmer and game designer with a passion for developing games and desktop apps. I have been programming and developing games since the age of 12. I strive to create horror games that are *actually* scary, regular games that are fun & entertaining, and apps that are truly useful, or even random.

As of recently, I have switched to Unreal Engine for game development, but previously used the Unity Engine, which I have years of experience with, as well as engines like [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), Construct 3, and Blitz3D.

When it comes to programming, I primarily use Python or Java, but it depends on the nature and "heftiness" of the app. However, I do have experience with C#, C, C++, the three webdev languages (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript), and a bit of BASIC. I also have VERY MINOR experience with x86 Assembly, but I am not great at it and do not use it often.

__My main goals for this career are:__
- Learn more of C++<sup>1</sup> and C
- Release at least a few *good* games
- Bring someone joy with one of my projects

<sup>1</sup>I absolutely *despise* C++, but I am willing to learn it for future projects.

Thanks for reading\
bye
