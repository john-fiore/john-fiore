# Hello & Welcome

My name is John Fiore, I'm 16-years-old, I'm from the Chicago Suburbs of Illinois, and I have a passion for game designing and programming. I enjoy designing/programming video games and programming different desktop apps and websites.

I started programming and developing games at the Age of 12, starting with languages like JavaScript and Python, and game engines like Construct 3 and Godot. By the time I was 13-14, I began developing various games in Unity and would tinker around with Python.

As of now, I use Unreal Engine 5 for game development and primarily use Java or Python for app development.
