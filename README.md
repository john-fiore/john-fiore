# Hi

My name is John Fiore, I'm 16-years-old, and I am from the Chicago Suburbs of Illinois, USA. I enjoy programming, developing games, and also playing them!

I have been programming since the age of 12, and typically work with **Python** and/or **Java**. However, I also use **C#** when working with Unity.

This is my GitHub page, where a lot of my code will land. This README file will be updated every now and then.

Facts about me:
- My **favorite** language is Python.
- I hate PHP and Ruby.
- My favorite games are GTA 5, RDR2, Half-Life series, and Cry of Fear.
- My favorite movie is The Truman Show.
- I am a VR player, and I love BONEWORKS & BONELAB (to an extent).

That's all. Thanks for stopping by!
